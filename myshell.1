NAME
       myshell — minimal and extensible shell

SYNOPSIS
       myshell [options]

DESCRIPTION
       MyShell is a POSIX‑style shell providing a basic environment with:
           • Command history and navigation
           • Tab completion for files and built‑in commands
           • Input/output redirection and pipelines (|, >, <, 2>)
           • Built‑in commands cd, exit, help

       Other commands are executed as in any standard shell.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display this help and exit.

       -v, --version
              Display the version and exit.

BUILT‑IN COMMANDS
       cd [directory]
              Change the current working directory.

       exit [status]
              Exit the shell with the specified exit code (default: 0).

       help [command]
              Display help for built‑in commands or general usage.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       On startup, MyShell reads ~/.myshellrc to customize:
           • The prompt (PS1 variable)
           • Aliases (one definition per line, e.g., alias ll='ls -la')

EXAMPLES
       $ myshell
       myshell> cd /var/log
       myshell> ls | grep error
       myshell> exit 0
